None of these artifacts are signed with an official key.
The Android APK can be side-loaded on most Android devices. If you had a previous Subsurface-mobile version installed from the Google Play store, you'll have to uninstall that first.
The Windows installer will ask you to confirm installation of an app from an unknown developer.
The macOS DMG makes it even harder with a multi-step dance that requires opening the Privacy & Security settings in the System Preferences and explicitly confirming that you are willing to install this app.

You can find similar Subsurface-Daily builds for [Ubuntu](https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/subsurface) and Subsurface-test for [Fedora](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dirkhh/Subsurface-test).

**Note:** Due to the asynchronous nature of our build process the artifacts for the individual platforms are added to the release one by one, whenever their build is finished. So if you can not find a particular artifact on a recent (less than 2 hours old) build, please come back later and check again.

Please report any issues with these builds in the [Subsurface user forum](https://groups.google.com/g/subsurface-divelog).
