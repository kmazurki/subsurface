          |:---------------------------|
          | We made some fairly drastic changes to the version numbering methodology. |
          | It's possible that this causes some confusion / surprising behavior in the next couple of CICD releases.     |

          CICD release artifact

          These builds are created on every merge or push into the [Subsurface repo](http://github.com/subsurface/subsurface).
          This build is based on http://github.com/subsurface/subsurface/commit/${{ github.sha }}

          None of these artifacts are signed.
          The Android APK can be side-loaded on most Android devices. If you had a previous Subsurface-mobile version installed from the Google Play store, you'll have to uninstall that first.
          The Windows installer will ask you to confirm installation of an app from an unknown developer.
          The macOS DMG makes it even harder with a multi-step dance that requires opening the Privacy & Security settings in the System Preferences and explicitly confirming that you are willing to install this app.

          You can find similar Subsurface-Daily builds for [Ubuntu](https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/subsurface) and Subsurface-test for [Fedora](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dirkhh/Subsurface-test).

          Please report any issues with these builds in the [Subsurface user forum](https://groups.google.com/g/subsurface-divelog).
